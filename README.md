# Intro to Dart

[Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/) is the programming language for Flutter, a mobile app SDK from Google. It can be built for multiple platforms:

* Mobile (Flutter)
* Web
* Server

This quick demo goes over:

* Simpple Class Structure - `Bicycle`
* Optional Parameters - `Rectangle`
* Factories - `Shape`
* Interfaces - `Shape 2`
* Functional Programming - `Scream`

## Installation

For server apps, for the extent of this demo, can be installed using this [guide](https://www.dartlang.org/install).

You can use the `Setup Wizard` if you're on Windows.

To validate the installation, run the command `dart --version`.

## Running the Application

To run any of the examples, run the command `dart <file>`.

For example: `dart bicycle.dart`
